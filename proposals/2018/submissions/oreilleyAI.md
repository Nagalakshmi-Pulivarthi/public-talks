# keras-pandas: Deep Learning for Tabular Data

## Proposal title

## Description* (brief overview for marketing purposes, max. length 400 charactersâ€”about 65 words)

Introducing keras-pandas, an open source package that allows users to rapidly build and iterate on deep learning models.

My recently open sourced package, keras-pandas, allows users to rapidly prototype and deploy models by providing state-of-the art defaults and heuristics, based on the techniques used in Fortune 100 companies and by kaggle grandmasters. 

## Abstract* (Longer, more detailed description of your presentation to help the program committee understand what you will cover. If your proposal is chosen, this is the description that will appear on the website. Note that our copywriters may edit it for consistency and O'Reilly voice.)

Introducing keras-pandas, an open source package that allows users to rapidly build and iterate on deep learning models.

Deep learning provides amazing opportunities to build highly predictive models. However, historically this modeling has required deep domain experience, and keeping up with a massive body of literature. Further, applying these approaches to tabular data has been a highly-specialized field. 

My recently open sourced package, keras-pandas, allows users to rapidly prototype and deploy models by providing state-of-the art defaults and heuristics, based on the techniques used in Fortune 100 companies and by kaggle grandmasters. 

During this talk, we'll dive into keras-pandas's design, have a look at a case study, and discuss real-world approaches for handling numerical, categorical, text, and timestamp data with deep learning. 

## Who is this presentation for?

Analysts, data scientists and data engineers who'd like to try or deploy deep learning models

## What's the takeaway for the audience? 

Deep learning is achievable, and doesn't require mounds of papers or scouring Kaggle message boards

## Prerequisite knowledge for this presentation

Familiarity with basic data types (numerical, categorical, timestamp). Knowledge of the Python data ecosystem is a plus, but not a need to have.

## Is this session more conceptual or how-to? 

How-to

No

## Additional notes 

I'm the primary author of keras-pandas, which was released 2 months ago and has picked up a user base including Google deep learning developers and hedge fund data scientists. I have yet to formally announce the package at a conference, and would like to during this conference. 

## Speaker

Brendan Herger enjoys bridging the gap between data science and engineering, to build and deploy data products.

Brendan brings a unique combination of machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering skills. In his previous work at Capital One and startups,  he has built authorization fraud, insider threat, and legal discovery automation platforms. In each of these cases he's lead a team of data scientists and data engineers to enable and elevate his client's business workflow (and capture some amazing data).

When he's not knee deep in a code base, Brendan can be found traveling, sharing his collection of Japanese teas, and playing board games with his partner in Seattle.
